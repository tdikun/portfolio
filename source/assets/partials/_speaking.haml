            I’ve had the pleasure of speaking at a few meetups, including <a href="http://designorlan.do/" target="_blank">Design Orlando</a> and the <a href="https://www.eastendmkt.com/events/food-and-farmpreneur-freelance-fair/" target="_blank">East End Market</a> small business workshop–where I also participated in a panel discussion. I’ve also written and taught a Code School course, the <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design" target="_blank">Fundamentals of Design</a>.

          %ul
            %li - Distilling Complex Software Goals into a Plan
            %li - Interactive Prototyping with Invision
